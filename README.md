# Webpack Template

This is a basic webpack template that I have created for myself to reduce the hassle of building a new webpack app for each project. It serves as a prototype that I can build upon for my future projects by installing other packages as needed.

## Usage

```bash
# Download the repository:
git clone https://github.com/DevVivan/webpack-template.git

# Change directory to the template:
cd webpack-template

# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```
